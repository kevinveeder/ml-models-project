    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "What factors can effectively contribute to a student's academic grade? Is it simply a matter of time spent studying or is there more that is involved with it? Does a students upbringing play a role? How do they choose to spend their time outside of the classroom? These are the questions that we are setting out to solve. \n",
    "\n",
    "In figuring out the answers to these questions, we could help student's achieve higher academic success and assist them to better achieve their goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Framing & Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Avising Team has been tasked with analyzing student data for the Portugese school system. We will attempt to create a machine learning model to predict students' performance based on certain relavent features. Our model will then be used to identify certain individuals who might need additional support to improve their grade in the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Framing the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we will be trying to predict the student's final grade, we will use build a model that utilizes supervised learning. In this type of learning, we will input our features, as well as respective labels into our algorithm, and the machine learning system will attempt to make a prediction based on that training data (i.e., the data that we will use to train our model.) Also, since our data won't be continuously updating, we will be training our data by way of batch learning, or also known as offline learning. This means that we will use all of the available data to train our model, learning all at one time. If we would want to update our data, then we would have to update the model and run it again. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Task\n",
    "\n",
    "For this model, we are choosing to run a regression task to predict the numeric final G3 grades. In regression tasks, we are trying to predict a continuous quantity, where as opposed to classification tasks where we would be trying to predict a discrete class label (e.g., if a student were to pass or fail.) By choosing regression, we are attempting to get a better understanding of the exact grade that the student would reach, giving us a better understanding of their knowledge in the course. Our thinking is that if we chose to do a classification task, we would just be predicting if they were to pass or fail, as opposed to if they got an A, B, C, and so on like we will see in our prediction using regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics for Model's Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "We will measuring the model's performance using cross-validation. Cross-validation helps us to hold out part of our data as a test set, and then after we have trained our model on our training data, we will test our model with the testing data, allowing us to see how well our model will do with predicting new instances. We will test the accuracy of our model using SciKit Learns built in `cross_val_score()` function with our estimator. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this to see our root mean squared error (RMSE), which is the difference between our predicted value and the actual values, and we will calculate the R-squared value which tells us the percent of variance that is explained by our models variables or features. "

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we were asked to make a model that we could use to accurately predict a students final grade based on other relevant features. In the end, we did just that. We have analyzed a few different approaches that we could take in moving forward with our results. If asked what the overall best prediction we could make would be, then we would choose the model that includes the G1 and G2 columns. Although, in some cases it would be beneficial to make predictions without using their first term and second term grades, and in that case we have a semi-reliable back up with the random forest regression that drops those term scores. I say semi-reliable because the overall predictions do show a root mean squared error of almost 4 points which could mean the difference of an entire grade. Overall though, it would still be more accurate than going in blind.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate what worked and what didn't, we can clearly see that we could be very accurate in predicting these final grades if we did use the first and second term grades, but since these columns are so highly correlated to our final grade variable, there are times when we wouldn't want to include them. One reason our model might not have been as effective as we would have liked might be because of our the variables, or features, that we did choose to keep in our model. We might have found more like by resticting our feature selection to less attributes or even by picking different ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some potential next steps to take here might be to try out some classification type models to see if we could have better luck with trying to predict if students are either pass or fail. Another avenue we might choose to take, is to use some more complex models since the models that we chose to fit our data weren't as complex in nature as many others that we might have chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any of these options might get us better results, but in the end I believe that we did do a good job with the direction that we chose to take, and provided valuable insights into what all goes into a students grade either inside or outside of the classroom."
