# Predicting Student Success
- End-to-end ML project for predicting student success using a variety of models.

What factors can affectively contribute to a student's academic grade? Is it simply a matter of time spent studying or is there more that is involved with it? Does a students upbringing play a role? How do they choose to spend their time outside of the classroom? These are the questions that we are setting out to solve.
